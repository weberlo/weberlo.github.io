  My name is Logan Weber,
  and I'm a PhD student at MIT,
  advised by <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/">Michael Carbin</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/saman/">Saman Amarasinghe</a>.
  <!-- My collaborators and I investigate the theoretical limits of programming language embeddings and evaluate the gap between these limits and solutions produced by neural methods. -->
  <!-- My collaborators and I investigate properties of programming languages that govern the ability of neural networks to embed them. -->
  <!-- I work at the intersection of programming languages and deep learning. -->
  <!-- The questions that drive my research are: (1) what can neural networks learn about programs and (2) how can we improve their ability to understand programs? -->
  The questions that drives my research is: what can neural networks learn about programs?
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
  In my spare time, I learn about the interplay between continuous mathematics and programming language theory, with the goal of discovering new frontiers for compilers research.
  To that end, I am inspired by homotopy type theory and Abstract Stone Duality.

  <p>
  Previously, I was a BS/MS student in the CS department at UW,
  where I worked in the
  <a href="http://uwplse.org/">PLSE</a> and
  <a href="http://sampl.cs.washington.edu/">SAMPL</a> groups.
  I am thankful to have been mentored by <a
    href="http://jroesch.github.io/">Jared Roesch</a> and <a
    href="https://tqchen.com/">Tianqi Chen</a> and to have been advised by <a
  href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/">Zachary Tatlock</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Before I worked in programming languages, I worked under <a href="https://www.countablethoughts.com">Adam Blank</a> as a teaching assistant for discrete mathematics and data structures courses and as a researcher in CS education.
  Together, we built software to assist students learning various CS concepts.
  Examples include: an induction tutor, an interface for constructing formal proofs, and a system for <a href="http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2014/CMU-CS-14-114.pdf">judgement-based grading</a>.

  <h1>Research Projects</h1>

  descriptions.

    <li>
      <b>Semantic Program Embeddings</b>,
      a project to theoretically characterize the difficulty of computing embeddings of programs that preserve semantic equivalences.
      Check the preprints below for more details!
      <!-- This project is something I worked on earlier in grad school.
      Initially, we were interested in developing a technique to embed programming languages by leveraging their unique properties.
      At the time, there was a big push for models that were adversarially robust, and the usual way that was implemented was by training for models whose predictions were invariant to semantics-preserving transformations.
      At some point, we realized we didn't even know how difficult of a task this is, so our goal became to study the computational complexity of embedding functions that possess this property.
      The core insights that came from this study were (1) that a language must have finitely many semantic equivalence classes for such an embedding function to exist and (2) that such an embedding function exists iff your language has an efficient canonicalizer.
      The theory isn't deep here, and with our definitions in place, these insights are actually quite trivial.
      So the contribution here was really just a lucid set of definitions rather than a theory of great technical complexity.
      We had trouble publishing this work because it turns out the languages that can be tractably embedded are extremely simple, so the work can be construed as pessimistic.
      Also, because the theory is so clean and simple, it really does come off as trivial once you've read through it, so we should have pulled the classic trick of obfuscating your work behind a layer of technical fluff... oh well. -->
